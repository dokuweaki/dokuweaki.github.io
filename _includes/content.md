# About

DokuWeaki is a bundle of plugins for DokuWiki especially targeted for agile teams, supporting agile documentation and following the philosophy of weakly typed wikis, aka as Weaki.

## Bundled plugins

### Comments

Enables users to add inline comments in page contents.

### GitHub Content Assist

This plugin lets users specify a GitHub *repository*, or a DokuWiki *page*. The contents of this repository or page will then be used to feed an autocomplete feature. While the user is typing, the suggestions mechanism of the feature will try to autocomplete the word.

### GitHub Integration

This plugin allows to automatically *push*, *pull* and *delete* files from GitHub when editing DokuWiki pages.

### JavaScript Code Transclusion

This plugin allows users to include a code snippet from GitHub in a DokuWiki page with a simple tag.

The snippet can either be an *entire file*, or a *single function* from that file.

###### * The inclusion of a complete file works for most programming languages. However, in order to include a single function the file must be a JavaScript file.

### Templating

This plugin enables users to create a new DokuWiki page with one of multiple skeleton templates. There is no need to create more pages from scratch.

It is also possible to add new starting templates for future use.
